# Project 5: RSA

## Objectives

In this lab you will develop a fully functional implementation of
RSA. You will gain experience with finding multiplicative inverses and
more practice with modular exponentiation.

## Background

In the Diffie-Hellman lab, you wrote your own modular exponentiation
function. We'll be using it a lot in this lab.

### RSA encryption and signing

Encryption and decryption are just a matter of taking your message or
ciphertext $m$ (less than $n$) and computing $m^e \bmod n$ or $m^d
\bmod n$.  $n$ is called the public modulus, $e$ the public exponent
and $d$ the private exponent. $n$ and $e$ together form the public
key. $n$ and $d$ together form the private key. $e$ is currently
conventionally set to 65537 because it's cheap to compute as a modular
exponent.

Encryption and decryption work because $(m^e)^d = m^ed = m (\bmod
n)$. $e$ and $d$ are chosen so that their product is equal to a
multple of $\phi(n)$ plus 1, that is to say: $e * d = 1 ( mod \phi(n)
)$, or $e * d = k * \phi(n) + 1$ for some (unimportant) value of
$k$. See the slides on RSA for details of why this is.

Given $(m^e) \bmod n$, it's hard to compute $m$ unless you know
$\phi(n)$ (in which case you can calculate $d$). Computing $\phi(n)$
is hard unless you know the factorization of $n$. To ensure that
factoring $n$ is hard, we make it the product of 2 large random
primes.

Signing is just encryption with the private exponent (what we normally
consider decryption). The receiver can “decrypt” the signature with
the public key to and verify that it matches the document. Since only
the owner of the key knows $d$, only she can sign documents.

### Calculating an RSA keypair

$e$ is conventionally set to 65537 (as long as it is relatively prime
to $\phi(n)$), so we just need to compute $d$ and $n$. As we
mentioned, n should be selected as the product of two large primes,
$p$ and $q$. To compute $d$, recall that it must be chosen such that
$ed = 1 \bmod \phi(n)$. But this just means that $d$ is $e$'s
multiplicative inverse modulo $\phi(n)$. $\phi(n)$ is just
$(p-1)(q-1)$ since $n$ only has two factors, $p$ and $q$. We can use
the extended Euclidian algorithm to compute modular inverses.

### Euclid's Algorithm

To test whether two numbers are relatively prime, you can use
[Euclid's
Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm).  You
will find pseudocode for several implementations on the Wikipedia
page.

### Generating primes

For the purposes of this lab, you are free to use any available
resource for generating your primes. OpenSSL provides a way to
generate primes, and many programming languages (such as Java) have
ways of generating large primes. This should be familiar to you from
the Diffie-Hellman lab.

There are several tests which are used to find large prime
numbers. Most of them are probabilistic; they'll tell you if a number
is certainly composite, but can't tell for sure whether a number is
prime. The Miller-Rabin test is probably the most respected of the
probabilistic algorithms. OpenSSL uses Miller-Rabin primality testing
to generate it's primes.

### Computing multiplicative inverses

The extended Euclidian algorithm is often used to compute
multiplicative inverses modulo some number. In this lab you will
implement it to find $d$. Remember that the method for computing the
$d$ by hand is somewhat different than what you will want to do on the
computer. The [Wikipedia page on the extended Euclidean
algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Euclidean_algorithm)
has pseudocode for computing modular inverses that may be useful.

## Requirements

Restrictions: You may use the language of your choice for this
lab. You may use a bignum library as in the Diffie-Hellman lab. You
may not use any built-in modular exponentiation, multiplicative
inverse, Euclid's algorithm, etc., but you may use code to help you
generate your prime numbers $p$ and $q$.

* Generate 2 512-bit primes $p$ and $q$. Ensure that their high order bit
  is set. Verify that $(p-1)(q-1)$ is relatively prime to 65537 (which
  we will be using for $e$). If it isn't, choose new $p$ and $q$
  values.


* Using $n=pq$ and $e=65537$, calculate the secret exponent $d$, such
    that $ed=1 \bmod \phi(n)$.  Verify that for numbers $m$ less than
   $n$, $((m^e \bmod n)^d )\bmod n == m$.

* On the passoff webpage, you will be given a value to encrypt. Use
  modular exponentation ($m^e \bmod n$) to encrypt the value.

* On the passoff webpage, you will be given a value to decrypt. Use
  modular exponentation ($m^d \bmod n$) to decrypt the value.
