# Project 9: Extracting Secrets

## Objectives

In this lab you will learn about the fundamental difficulties in
restricting what users can do with the data on their computers. You
will also:

* Learn how any traditional content restriction mechanism can be
easily circumvented.

* Learn how "protected" data can be easily extracted from any
application.

## Overview

For many years, software companies have tried to restrict what users
may do with the applications they buy. Often, these efforts have
focused on preventing users from running applications on more than one
computer. More recently, they've tried to restrict what users may do
with data such as video, audio and even text.

In 1998, congress passed the Digital Millenium Copyright Act. Among
other things, it specifies that "No person shall circumvent a
technological measure that effectively controls access to a work
protected under this title." The problem with this clause as it
relates to computers is that in their present state, no technological
measures can effectively prevent a computer owner from accessing the
data on his own machine!

## Requirements

1. Download [fortune_static](/static/files/secrets/fortune_static), a
   statically linked Linux executable, and
   [fortunes.enc](/static/files/secrets/fortunes.enc), a file with
   encrypted content. When you run `fortune_static`, it will ask you
   for the "CD key," a password designed to restrict access to the
   program. You will not be given a valid CD key.

1. Use a debugger to bypass this password mechanism and make the
   program function normally. Instead of exiting, it will print out a
   random quote from the file `fortunes.enc`. This is done by modifying
   variables, registers, return addresses, etc. using the
   debugger. (See the ddd manual or gdb manual for help)

1. Now that you understand the code, open the executable in a hex
   editor (e.g., bless, vim) and modify the assembly code so that you
   can obtain a fortune every time you run the program. Perhaps any CD
   key that you enter will now work, for instance. You may be able to
   insert noops (0x90) to effectively crack the
   executable. Dr. Seamons was able to do this by modifying just one
   byte in the executable using vim as a hex editor. The result will
   be a new executable file that you can run and obtain a fortune.
   
1. Find a way to obtain all of the plaintext fortunes from
fortunes.enc using the debugger.

## Tips

To run `fortune_static` on a Linux machine, be sure it is set to be
executable. You can do this with:

```
chmod u+x fortune_static
```

To disassemble `fortune_static` while keeping the hex values for each
instruction that is executed, use the following command in the
terminal:

```
objdump -d fortune_static > dump.txt
```

This will disassemble the entire program and store the result in the file dump.txt

## Report

Generate a written report for the lab that addresses the following items. Please number each item for clarity.

1.  How did you use the debugger to bypass the password mechanism?
    What variables did you modify? Please include a screenshot of the
    debugger in your report.
	
1. How did you edit the program to bypass the cdkey mechanism?
	
1. How did you obtain all the fortunes from the encrypted file?

Include the following in your report.

* a plain text section containing the list of all fortunes from the
  fortunes.enc file

* a screenshot of the debugger that shows you were able to access the
  plain text fortunes in memory.


## NOTE:
* Using probabilistic methods to extract all the fortunes will not receive full credit.  You should include a brief description of what you did to ensure that you have extracted all the fortunes.  A NOT acceptable description would be "I ran the program 1000 times and collected all the unique outputs."  An example of an acceptable solution would be "A used the debugger to change the output of the random number generator sequentially walking through all possibilities." or "I extracted the key that was used to encrypt the fortune file and decrypted it." or "I found where the decrypted fortunes were in memory and printed them all from there from the debugger." There are other possible methods of doing this which are likely acceptable. 

## Submission

Submit a PDF of your report on Learning Suite, including all the
things asked for in each section.
