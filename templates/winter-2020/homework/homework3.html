# Homework #3

You may study the modes together, but please work out these answers on
your own. Summative Grading Assignment.

Complete each question described below. When comparing blocks of
ciphertext or plaintext, if corresponding blocks differ then mention
which specific blocks differ. If they differ by only 1 bit, mention
that fact specifically. If they differ by more than 1 bit, simply
state the specific blocks that differ completely. If all blocks differ
in the full ciphertext, simply state that there is no relationship. Be
as precise as you can in your comparisons to illustrate that you
understand the various modes.

1. Suppose two plaintext samples P and Q are encrypted using a block
cipher with the same secret key K and the same initialization vector
IV (or nonce) for those modes that require it. Suppose each plaintext
sample is divided into 100 blocks (including padding). If all the
plaintext blocks of P and Q are the same, except for block 10, in
which they differ by 1 bit, compare the corresponding ciphertext for
each block cipher mode

    * ECB
    * CBC
    * CTR
    * CFB
    * OFB

1. Same as #1, except assume P and Q are encrypted with a different IV
(nonce) as recommended by cryptographers.

    * ECB
    * CBC
    * CTR
    * CFB
    * OFB

1. Suppose two ciphertext samples P and Q are decrypted using key K
and the same IV (or nonce) when required. Suppose each ciphertext
sample of 100 blocks differs by 1 bit in block 25 only. Compare the
corresponding plaintext blocks following decryption of P and Q for
each block cipher mode.

    * ECB
    * CBC
    * CTR
    * CFB
    * OFB

1. Assume each ciphertext block is stored on a separate disk block
that can be accessed independently. Suppose only block 50 of an
encrypted file of 100 blocks needs to be accessed. Which specific
blocks of ciphertext must be accessed to obtain the plaintext for
block 50 for the following modes?

    * ECB
    * CBC
    * CTR
    * CFB
    * OFB

1. Which modes permit parallel encryption?

1. Which modes permit parallel decryption?

1. Which modes permit pre-computation of the key stream?
