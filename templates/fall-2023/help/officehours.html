#Office Hours

I'm not on campus much - but I'd be happy to meet with you as needed.  I'll also meet with you via zoom by appointment as needed. Please find me on our class slack workspace to make an appointment, or email me.  You'll also find me on Slack a lot if you just have a quick question.  Try the TAs first since I'm working a full time job and teaching at the same time.

##TA Office hours and location

Find the TAs on the class slack workspace or in 1156 TMCB TBD.

These are for last semester - still working out TA hours for fall 2023
