Symmetric Encryption



	AES – how to implement the finite field add/multiply


	Be able to multiply two numbers using Finite Field multiply - class example was to multiply 0x21 * 0x0C


	Modes of execution – how they work, why we have them, pros and cons



		I will give you pictures of how the modes work - don't memorize them




	Padding – when and why



One-way hash function



	6 security properties


	Pre-image attack vs. collision attack


	I will give you SHA-1 diagram, understand how it works from the diagram



Message authentication code



	Definition - abstract idea of a MAC, 3 ways to implement


	Terminology and various meanings - MAC, HMAC


	How the message extension attack works


	Design of HMAC specification to thwart extension attack



Public key cryptography



	Encryption vs. digital signatures


	Diffie Hellman and RSA


	Generating RSA parameters using the extended Euclidean algorithm


	Why DH and RSA are secure


	What is the public key and private key in RSA?


	How do we use RSA to encrypt and sign application data?



Digital certificates



	Five steps a relying party uses to verify a certificate


	Certificate chains


	How to repair a certificate hierarchy when a key is compromised




# Midterm #1 Study Guide

* **terminology and cryptography slides**

* **AES**: how it works, finite field multiplication

* **block cipher modes**: differences between them, what an IV is for

* **cryptographic hash functions**: their properties and applications, how
  SHA1 works

* **MAC**: their properties, why a CBC is vulnerable to a bit-flipping
  attack, different ways to implement a MAC, what an HMAC is, how the
  MAC attack lab works, how the HMAC works (what does Alice send Bob,
  how does Bob check it)

* **Diffie-Hellman**: what it means for two numbers to be relatively
  prime, what GCD is, modular arithmetic, additive and multiplicative
  inverses, modular exponentiation, how Diffie-Hellman works (what
  Alice sends Bob, what Bob sends Alice, how they get the resulting
  key), why DH is secure, how you could attack DH

* **RSA**: textbook description of RSA, why RSA is secure, how to choose
  and/or calculate RSA parameters, how you use RSA, how to calculate
  the *d* parameter using the Extended Euclidean Algorith, by hand

* **PKI**: what a digital certificate is, how signing a certificate
  works, steps needed to verify a certificate, how the CA system for
  the web works, what Let's Encrypt does, weaknesses of the CA system,
  how Certificate Transparency works and what problem it solves,
  tradeoffs of various revocation methods
